# ACQC

The ACQC repository includes the MATLAB implementation of the ACQC and original QC methods:

N. Abdolmaleki, L. Mohammad Khanli, M. Hashemzadeh, and  S. Pourbahrami "ACQC"

The SourceCode contains two folders:
1) MainACQC, for running the code you must start with ACQCscript.m as the main script of the ACQC method.
2) OrginalQC, for running the code you must start with QCscript.m as the main script of the original QC method.


All folder contains two folders: dataset0(include synthetic datasets) and dataset1(include 20 real-world datasets).
